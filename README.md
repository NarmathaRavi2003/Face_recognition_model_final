# Face_recogntion_model_final

Develop a real-time face recognition system using Tkinter for the frontend and Python for the backend. The system should capture images from a webcam, detect faces using Dlib, and identify users using the face_recognition library. If an unknown user is detected, prompt them to register by entering their name and capturing their image. Save the registered user's image to a local database for future recognition. Recognized users should be greeted with a welcome message displaying their name. The system should provide a seamless user experience with real-time face detection, identification, and registration capabilities.
